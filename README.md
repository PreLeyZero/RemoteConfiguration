Remote Configuration allows you to click on any machine at any distance and open its GUI. While the GUI is open, you can change configurations (e.g. combinator signals, chest limits, spidertron logistic requests) but you can't transfer any items. Since you need to be able to select the machines, radar coverage is required.

## Compatibility

- Compatible with any mod, including [Far Reach](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/far-reach)
- Works with [Space Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration), although functionality is mostly superseded by SE's Navigation Satellite
- Recommended with [Wire Shortcuts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/WireShortcuts) for long distance wire connections
- Utilises vanilla's permissions system, so may break if you aren't using the **Default** permissions group. Let me know if you'd like me to improve the interactions in this area
